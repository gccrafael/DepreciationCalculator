This program receives some information from an user in order to calculate 
the depreciation on an asset over a period of time.
These entries are referent to an asset:
-name;
-cost;
-salvage value(residual value); and
-life cycle.

These data will be employed to calculate two types of depreciation:
-straight line
(In straight line depreciation, the difference between 
cost and salvage value is just divided by the number of years of service 
expected.  So, if our $30,000 truck is worth $5000 after 5 years of useful
life, then the depreciation per year is (30000 - 5000) / 5 = $5000); and

-double declining balance
(In this method, you still use purchase price and salvage value, but the 
depreciation calculated each year is at twice the rate of straight line 
(but not exactly twice the amount).Typically, at some point the double-declining 
method will produce yearly depreciation amounts below straight line – but instead 
of continuing with the declining method, at that point the straight line amount 
is used instead.)
